  <h3>Her Homelife</h3>
  <p>
 I'm a San Francisco Native, Wife, Mother and lifelong Student who has lived in her neighborhood long enough to see a primarily
 residential area morph into a mix of homes, "Live to Work" spaces, restaurants and condominiums. My family and I live in the house I grew up in
 and we know almost all of the people who live on our block. I like that because we are real neighbors in the true sense
 of the word. We watch over and take care of each other.
   </p>
  <h4>Her Spirituality</h4>
  <p>God is my rock. He has sustained me throughout my life experiences. If you don't get it,
     or agree with me its ok. To each his own.</p>

  <h3>Her Worklife</h3>
  <p>I'm semi-retired with 30 years of experience in the telecommunications industry. I rose up from the non-salaried ranks of operator services
    to make a pit stop in consumer sales and service so that I could learn how to consult with customers and treat them well. I also learned to
    the valued skill of remaining calm under intense pressure. Later, I used those skills to become an individual contributor in Global Markets Sales Operations.
    I like discovering how things work and figuring out problems and that lead me to the position where I spent remaining 15 years of my career at AT&T.
    I became a subject matter expert and team lead in a workgroup which was responsible for improving processes by implmenting automation of manual workflows associated
    with ordering AT&T product. I'm very familiar with the Software Development Lifecycle process. My job responsibilities included drafting software
    documentation, participation in and leading of user experience testing, defect management, and end user training. In my last position, I was lead for the
    system support documentation and user communications. As the lead I was the admin, creator, editor and contributor for two systems I supported. For my next
    "career", I'd like to tap into my creative side. I am currently "dabbling" in web design and learning front end development.

       to get the skills I need FREE! In addition to the technical courses, I also want to take voice, art, and baking classes because those are things
       I like to do. As the saying goes, do what you love, money will follow. </p>

  <h2>Who is this person?</h2>
  <h3>Her Homelife</h3>
  <p>I'm married to my wonderful loving husband of 27 years.
    I'm blessed with 3 beautiful offspring, aged 27, 20 and 16.
     My kids are my pride and joy. I'm a San Francisco Native and I've lived in my neighborhood long
     enough to see the Mayonaise factory across the street morph into to two other businesses. The latest one is a much needed kidney
     dialysis center. I live in the house I grew up in and I know
     almost all of the people who live on our block. I like that because
     we take care of each other.</p>
  <h4>Her Spirituality</h4>
  <p>God is my rock. He has sustained me throughout
     my life experiences. If you don't get it,
     or agree with me its ok. To each his own.</p>
  <h3>Her Worklife</h3>
  <p>I'm a retired AT&T employee with 30 years of experience in the telecommunications industry.
    For the last 15 years of my career I've been an integral player on team that had the task of automating manual processes
   associated with ordering AT&T product. I'm very familiar with the Software Development Lifecycle
    process as it relates to AT&T. I have 15 years of experience in drafting software documentation,
    user experience testing, defect management, and end user training. In my last position,
    I was responsible for the system support documentation and user communications.
    I created and managed the system wiki which was repository for the training documents,
    test cases, project documents and more. In my next job I want the opportunity to use my
    creativity more, whatever that looks like.</p>
    <h3>Her Continuing Education</h3>
    <p>I'm taking classes at <a href="https://www.udemy.com"> Udemy.com</a> and <a href="https.udacity.com">Udacity.com</a>, two online colleges
      so that I can further enhance my technical skillset. I want to be more marketable. I enrolled in Mission Tech
      so that I can learn a few programming languages as many of the jobs i'm interested in require some programming skill.
      In addition to the technical courses, I also will be taking voice and possibly an art class because those are things I like to do.</p>

    <li>I like to Sing. Singing gives me joy and its good for the soul.<a/></li>

      for my creativity. Plus it tastes good. Why not make a little cash off of it?<a/>

      I love the mystery and the challenge of figuring out who did the crime.</li>
    <li>Im a Social Media addict of sorts, but more out of necessity.
    Facebook keeps me connected with far away relatives and friends for free.

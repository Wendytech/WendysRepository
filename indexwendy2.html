<h2>HTML</h2>
<h3>What is HTML?</h3>
<h4>DEFINITION: The anacrynm HTML is short for hypertext markup language.</h4>
<h4> From Wikipedia and rephrased just a little, "Hypertext Markukp Language is the standard markup language used for creating webpages or web applications. Its used with CSS (cascading style sheets) and JavaScript on the Web. Web Browsers are sent HTML documents from a webserver or from local storage and once this hits the web users see multimedia web pages". So what does this mean to me? It means that HTML is widely recognized and everybody uses it. Additionally, HTML is partnered with CSS and JavaScript in order to create web pages which can display text and multimedia i.e. pictures, videos, etc like what we see on social media sites or news outlets. </h4>
